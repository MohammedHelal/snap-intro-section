## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The dropdown menus gave me a bit of trouble at the beginning but the sidenav on the mobile display was the most difficult to build, I had to re-organize the code to fit it, and in the process I learned a lot about flexbox and javascript in general.

### Continued development

I will continue learning more about flexbox and modal creation.
